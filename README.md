So why did I choose Next.js? \
1. Core features: directory based routing and built in server components \
2. Ease of adoption from React, and the fact that I wanted to learn a full stack framework \
3. Experiment 

I plan to add continue working on this application and maybe port it into mobile. \
As per a suggestion, there are also plans to transform this application into a all-in-one productivity app \
with features such as a pomodoro timer, calendars, and more. I look forward to working on it.
